LeadSheets Music App - located at http://18.221.174.186/leadsheets_home.php

LeadSheets is a tool for storing chord progressions of songs for easy lookup. As a musician I often jam with friends and this site allows us to easily store our songs and make them accessible on the web in a friendly manner. Additionally the app has the feature to transpose songs into any key you like. This is very useful because many people like to play or sing in certain keys and this allows everyone to get on the page together. 

Lyric storage is the next step, hopefully coming soon. Also want to create a better interface for editing songs that have already been stored in our database.
